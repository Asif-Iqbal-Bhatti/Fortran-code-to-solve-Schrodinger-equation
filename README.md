*Fortran code to solve Schrodinger equation: Solution to Hydrogen & Helium atom by LAPACK subroutines*

The difference among these solvers dsyev, dsbev and dstebz resides in the execution time. In the case of dstebz, the execution time is faster as seen by local CPU_time. Since, in this routine eigenvalues can be
called in the given range, which implies no need for extra calculation. If compared to dsbev subroutine the diagonal and sub or super-diagonal term are stored in another matrix of these dimensions which
is a little faster. Lastly, dsyev just takes the given matrix and solves for eigenvalues and optionally eigenvectors. Over here it doesnâ€™t do any extra effort of assigning matrix to other dimensions and solve.
So, if by execution time (by calling CPU_time subroutine) it could be stated in this way

dstebz < dsbev < dsyev
