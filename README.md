# Fortran code to solve 1D Schrodinger equation
*Fortran code to solve Schrodinger equation: Solution to Hydrogen & Helium atom by LAPACK subroutines*

The difference among these solvers dsyev, dsbev and dstebz resides in the execution time. In the case of dstebz, the execution time is faster as seen by local CPU_time. Since, in this routine eigenvalues can be
called in the given range, which implies no need for extra calculation. If compared to dsbev subroutine the diagonal and sub or super-diagonal term are stored in another matrix of these dimensions which
is a little faster. Lastly, dsyev just takes the given matrix and solves for eigenvalues and optionally eigenvectors. Over here it doesnâ€™t do any extra effort of assigning matrix to other dimensions and solve.
So, if by execution time (by calling CPU_time subroutine) it could be stated in this way

```
dstebz < dsbev < dsyev

DSYEV computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for symmetric matrices,

DSBEV computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a real symmetric band matrix.

DSTEBZ computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix T. The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (V L; V U], or the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues.
